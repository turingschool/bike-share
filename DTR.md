Group Expectations

Group Member Names: Becki, Aram, Joel, Ricky

Project Manager: Ricky

Defining the Relationship (DTR) Questions:

When are group members available to work together?
Becki - Likes to leave by 6:30
Joel - Has 4 kids, drop and pick up. May have to do something Friday night.
Aram - coming in on weekends, likes to be here in person.
Ricky - Likes to have one day away from Turing.

We'll be getting together on Saturday to go over everything.

What does each group member hope to get out of the project?
Becki - Solidly understanding the interplay between sinatra and activerecord and RSpec.
Joel - Would like to get stronger in his ActivRecord, especially in the dashboard.
Aram - Obtaining a lot more active record skills, clarity on migrations.
Ricky - Learning activerecord and understanding HTML's syntax more. Waffle and Git(hub) Workflow.

How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

If not face-to-face then Slack/waffle. We can slack whenever but with no expectation that we need to respond after 10pm and before 8pm.

What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?
Immediately speak up so that everyone is aware of the issue. This is all brand new information for most of us. It is not just one person's problem it is everyone's problem.

Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?
Joel - Turing makes him swear a lot.
Becki - Prefer direct communication, can come of as blunt. She may not realize that it came off that way. PLease feel free to approach her about that.
Aram - Same as Becki.
Ricky - Approaches everything with a solutions-oriented mindset. Hard to express himself, feel free to pull things out from him.
