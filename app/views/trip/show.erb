<!-- When a user visits the `/trips` path, they should only see the first thirty trips taken organized by date. On that page, there should also be a button to see the next thirty trips. Once a user visits a second page, there should be buttons to move both forward and backward in time.-->

<!-- Additionally, users should be able to delete a trip from the views rendered at both `/trips/:id` and `/trips`.  This just means that the delete button has to be inside the  loop for creating each listing.-->
