How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

  Preferred Mode of Communicaton: Slack.

  We plan to communicate once a day as a group, in person, but then to allow individual features to be developed without a required frequency of communication.

What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature?

  Pair up over the weekend (1-2hrs) and work with a person on your weakness.

Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

  Mike: gets quiet when frustrated
