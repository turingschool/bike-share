## Setting Group Expectations

Group Member Names: 

1. When are group members available to work together? What hours can each group member work individually? Are there any personal time commitments that need to be discussed? 

All of us: Signed up for JavaScript class next Tuesday.
Lauren: I work Wednesday night before the project is dueeeee. 
Victoria: Might be volunteering for Try Turing on Saturday or Sunday.
Saturday evening: Can we have that off? :)

2. How will group members communicate? How often will communication happen, and how will open lines of communication be maintained?

Stand-Ups before school start (8:45am) or at lunch, or just before we start work [Victoria goes to imposters lunch on Tuesday/Wednesday.]
BB Channel + GitHub/Slack Integration

3. Which feature(s) does each group member *want* to work on? Which feature(s) does each group member *not want* to work on?

Still up-in-the-air since features are not fully understood right now, but we all are intimidated by styling but do really want to practice that!

4. What does each group member hope to get out of the project?

Brett: better understanding of the MVC model, more knowledge of ActiveRecord methods, better understanding of URL params-data conversion
Danny: get better at ActiveRecord
Victoria: fully-functional, plus some extensions
Lauren: better understanding of databases and practice styling

5. What is the agreed upon Git workflow? What project management tool will be used? What is the agreed upon procedure for conducting code reviews before merging into master: who will review pull requests, and when?

Git workflow: slack when PR is ready to be merged - Danny being repo-manager to review pull requests. 
Try to submit PR to teacher ever once every iteration.

6. What is expected of group members when they run into problems implementing a feature? 

Bring it up as soon as possible. Don't be a hero. Be open to letting the group help fix it, and the group should be kind and helpful.

7. How does each group member want feedback (both positive and constructive) to be delivered? 

All of the above in a nice way, we guess.

8. Is there anything else the group should know about personal work/communication styles?

Lauren: currently working on communicating while coding and preventing "rushing ahead" (Danny agrees he's working on this too)
Brett: working on timeboxing so he doesn't go down a hole
Victoria: does like to do things on her own if possible (Lauren totally agrees)

Possible work suggestions, split up into pairs to tackle separate features.
